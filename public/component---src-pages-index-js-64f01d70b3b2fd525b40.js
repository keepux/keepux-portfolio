To be more precise, we need quantifiable ways to measure qualatative properties. Does this sound like an oxymoron? Some might say it does. How do we measure quality exactly? Some have valuable insight on the matter, while others may say it's a balance of art and science or a right brain, left brain thing. We feel like discipline is a better way to describe the essence of the craft. One statement that we can most all agree on is that a delightful experience is the goal. Defining what exactly the experience is, however, both, a creative, and a scientific process."),s.default.createElement("br",null),s.default.createElement("p",{className:"leading-loose"},"Furthermore, creating delightful experiences requires knowledge of how decisions are made. Intuition plays a significant role in determining the complex and often subconscious sets of decisions that a person might make in their interactions with a product. UX gives us a set of guidelines and methods, that allow us to better understand those decisions and possible actions, which may or may not be mostly guided by intuition, and how we might improve, and/or guide, new design decisions to allow for an improvement in the overall interaction. Remember, the set of guidelines can exist in either qualatative, quantitative, or both states."),s.default.createElement("br",null),s.default.createElement("p",{className:"leading-loose"},"Naturally, quantifiable methods are somewhat engineer friendly and they are mesurable by their very fabric. Ok, good, so we have established that we can measure quantifiable data. So how do we measure qualatative data, and even more importantly, how do we present the data in a way that any improvements can be measured? The discipline of UX design sets out to addresses this question. It offers strategic ways of illustrating, interpreting and integrating the various components of design and production which can have tremendous benefit to the overall process of how delightful products are made."))};t.default=d,e.exports=t.default}});
