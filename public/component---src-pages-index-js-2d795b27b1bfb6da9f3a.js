This statement sounds great, however, it might be jumping ahead a bit, and may be initially a bit too broad for an opening statement without a bit of a primer on UX.",o.default.createElement("div",null,"Lets step back and take a look at the statement from a differient perspective. To be more precise, we need quantifiable ways to measure qualatative properties. Sounds like an oxymoron? Some might say it is. How does one measure quality? Some have valuable insight on the matter, while others may say it's a balance of art and science or a right brain, left brain thing. We feel like discipline is a better way to describe the craft. One statement that we can most all agree on is that a delightful experience is the goal. Defining what exactly the experience is specifically, is both, a creative, and a scientific process."),o.default.createElement("div",null,"First, creating a delightful experience requires knowledge of how decisions are made. Second, intuition plays a significant role in determining the complex and often subconscious set of decisions that a person might make in interacting with a design. Third, and assuming we are talking about an interactive product, the craft of UX is the set of guidelines, or methods, that allow us to better understand the decisions and possible actions, which can be mostly guided by intuition, and how we might improve, and/or guide, those design decisions to allow for an improvement in the overall interaction. Also, remember, the set of guidelines can exist in either qualatative, quantitative, or both states."),o.default.createElement("div",null,"Naturally, quantifiable methods are inherintly somewhat engineer friendly and they are mesurable by their very fabric. Ok, good, so we can measure quantifiable data. So how do we measure qualatative data and even more importantly, how do we present the data in a way that improvements are measurable? The discipline of UX design sets out to addresses this question. Furthermore, it offers strategic ways of illustrating, interpreting, and integrating (yes, we think oxford commas rock!) the various components of design and production which can have tremendous benefit to the overall process of how delightful products are made.")))};t.default=d,e.exports=t.default}});
